    output Price History in products
    requests and output in client tabs

    what happens when the user deletes one input and then presses submit (empty string in state value)?
    what about date and time - change in all forms
    GENERALLY CHECK UPDATE HANDLERS (send everything? send only what the user types)
    add outline: none in all form inputs
    add reset form button in all forms
    add toggle in transactions 
        new mode will also include category_id in form
        in old mode fix quantity (add second ball in slider - copy from total_amount)
